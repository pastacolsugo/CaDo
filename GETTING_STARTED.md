# _CaDo_ developing guide
## The basics
_CaDo_ is hosted on a GitHub repo, at [https://github.com/eutampieri/CaDo](https://github.com/eutampieri/CaDo). GitHub is a hosting server based on [`git`](https://`git`-scm.org). `git` is a version control system, a software that is used to safely work together on the same set of files.
To learn how to use `git`, read [this wonderful guide by GitHub](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/). Your IDE probably has some `git` integration builtin, so check its documentation too.
### Github tips
* The [branch status page](https://github.com/eutampieri/CaDo/network) is really worth looking at
## Repository structure
The stable branch is `master`, all the others are developement branches. In the root directory there are some documentation files.
## Contributing
First of all, you have to follow the rules stated in the `CONTRIBUTING` file. The most important thing is to create a branch instead of commiting directly to the `master` branch.
